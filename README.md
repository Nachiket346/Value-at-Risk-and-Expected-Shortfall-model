# Value-at-Risk-and-Expecetd-Shortfall-model
A full market risk modelling project demonstrating VaR/ES, stress testing — designed as a proof-of-work for risk roles.

SUMMARY
This project develops an end to end Market Risk analytics framework in Python, designed as a professional proof of work for roles in Market Risk, Risk Management.

Core Components:
Historical, Parametric (Gaussian), and Monte Carlo Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) estimation across all methods • 
Variables stress tested: mean shocks,volatility shocks, and correlation stress •

Risk Dashboard :
Side by side VaR/ES comparison charts,Normal vs Crisis VaR visualizations Rolling VaR tracking,Fully modular plotting system (Matplotlib + Plotly).

Technical Stack:Python,Yfinance, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook.

Outcome:
This project demonstrates the ability to build a complete, production-style Market Risk modeling framework from scratch, covering VaR, Expected Shortfall, stress testing, Monte Carlo simulation. It showcases strong skills in quantitative modeling, financial risk analysis, and Python-based risk system development — aligned directly with the expectations of Market Risk Analyst roles in banks, investment firms, and risk departments.

Future Enhancements:
Stressed covariance VaR
GARCH(1,1) volatility-based VaR
T-distribution parametric VaR
Expected Shortfall regression (ESReg)
EVT (Extreme Value Theory) Peaks-Over-Threshold model
